# **GURPS Antique Aether Campaign Notes**

## **Core Premise**

* **System:** GURPS 4th Edition  
* **Setting:** Space Opera, Post-Collapse  
* **Rules In Use:** GURPS - Basic Set, GURPS Traveller - Interstellar Wars (Spaceships and Jump Travel), GURPS High-Tech
* **Timeline:** ~150 years after the collapse of a large human empire.
* **State of Humanity:** Recovering and expanding from isolated pockets, primarily former agriworlds that maintained population density. General tech level has fallen, but some areas are regaining TL10 capabilities.  
* **Key Tech Constraint:** No sentient AI. Computer technology peaks around the level of the computers seen in Star Trek (highly capable, conversational interface, but not self-aware).  
* **Former Empire:** Thoroughly TL10 at its height, with isolated TL11 advancements.

## **Key Themes**

* Rebuilding & Recovery  
* Exploration & Rediscovery  
* Lost Glory & Lingering Dangers  
* Varied Tech Levels & Cultures  
* Rediscovering/Recreating the New Social Order
* Humanity's Unique Magic

## **Character Creation Guidelines**

* **Base Points:** 150 points  
* **Disadvantages:** Up to -100 points allowed. Sensible choices appropriate to the setting are expected.
* **Attributes:** Minimum 7, Maximum 14.
* **Build/Size:** Any permitted.  
* **Age:** No Children or Elderly PCs.  
* **Appearance:** No Horrific, Monstrous, or Transcendent.  
* **Tech Level:** Native TL is TL10 (or recovering towards it). High TL advantage is not permitted.  
* **Language:** Assume functional literacy for PCs.  
* **Wealth:** Dead Broke and Multimillionaire are not permitted. Independent Income requires justification.  
* **Status/Rank:** Rank is tied to a character's faction or military structure. High Status requires justification based on background and affiliation.  
* **Contacts:** All PCs receive 33 points worth of Contacts for free. Must purchase at least 3 contacts if using any of these points.
* **Innate Human Magic:** All human PCs begin play with Magery 0 [5 points] for free, reflecting humanity's inherent potential. Higher levels of Magery may be purchased normally.

## **House Rules & Setting Specifics**

*   **Cybernetics:** Use GURPS Ultra-Tech p. 207 rules. Is available at TL10 areas.
*   **Baseline Skill Expectations:** PCs are expected to possess skills covering:
    *   **Social Interaction (Carousing, Diplomacy, Fast-Talk, Interrogation)**
        *   *Consider:* In a post-collapse society, navigating social situations is crucial. Diplomacy can avert wars, Fast-Talk can get you out of trouble, and Interrogation can uncover vital secrets. Even Carousing can build alliances in unexpected places. A charming rogue or a silver-tongued diplomat will find these skills invaluable.
    *   **Movement (Climbing, Hiking, Stealth)**
        *   *Consider:* Exploring ruins, traversing wilderness, or evading enemies often requires more than just walking. Climbing allows access to hidden areas, Hiking ensures you can reach remote locations, and Stealth keeps you out of sight when necessary. A resourceful explorer or a cunning infiltrator will rely on these skills.
    *   **Travel (Driving, Riding - or Piloting/Navigation equivalents based on GURPS Traveller)**
        *   *Consider:* Getting around is essential, whether it's piloting a starship, driving a ground vehicle, or riding a local mount on a low-tech world. Navigation skills are crucial for avoiding hazards and finding your way in uncharted territory. A daring pilot, a skilled driver, or a knowledgeable navigator are always in demand.
    *   **Support (First Aid)**
        *   *Consider:* Medical technology might be advanced, but it's not always available. Knowing First Aid can save lives when professional help is delayed or unavailable. A quick-thinking medic or a self-reliant survivor will prioritize this skill.
    *   **Communication (Gesture)**
        *   *Consider:* Language barriers are common in a fragmented galaxy. Gesture allows you to communicate basic information even when you don't speak the local language. A savvy trader or a seasoned traveler will find this skill surprisingly useful.
    *   **Awareness/Utility (Observation, Scrounging, Search)**
        *   *Consider:* Noticing important details, finding useful items, and locating hidden objects are essential for survival and success. Observation helps you spot ambushes, Scrounging provides vital resources, and Search uncovers valuable clues. A perceptive investigator or a resourceful scavenger will master these skills.
    *   **Social Navigation (Savoir-Faire, Streetwise)**
        *   *Consider:* Knowing how to behave in different social circles and understanding the undercurrents of society can open doors and prevent trouble. Savoir-Faire allows you to blend in with the elite, while Streetwise helps you navigate the criminal underworld. A cunning socialite or a street-smart hustler will rely on these skills.
    *   **Basic Melee (Axe/Mace, Broadsword, Knife, Shortsword, Staff)**
        *   *Consider:* While ranged weapons are common, melee combat is often unavoidable in close quarters or when weapons malfunction. Proficiency with a blade or bludgeon can be the difference between life and death. A hardened mercenary or a skilled duelist will be prepared for close combat.
    *   **Basic Ranged (Beam Weapons, Guns - or Bow/Crossbow on lower-tech worlds)**
        *   *Consider:* Ranged combat is a primary means of defense and attack in most situations. Whether it's wielding a beam weapon, firing a slugthrower, or using a bow on a primitive world, knowing how to handle a ranged weapon is crucial. A sharpshooting bounty hunter or a well-trained soldier will excel in ranged combat.
    *   **Unarmed Combat (Boxing, Brawling, Karate)**
        *   *Consider:* Sometimes, weapons are unavailable or impractical. Knowing how to fight unarmed can provide a vital edge in a brawl or self-defense situation. A tough enforcer or a disciplined martial artist will be skilled in unarmed combat.
    *   **Utility Combat (Forced Entry, Holdout, Judo/Wrestling, Throwing)**
        *   *Consider:* These skills offer non-lethal or tactical advantages in combat. Forced Entry allows you to breach defenses, Holdout lets you conceal weapons, Judo/Wrestling provides grappling options, and Throwing can disable opponents or create distractions. A sneaky operative or a resourceful tactician will utilize these skills.
 *   **Vacuum Suit**
        *   *Consider:* In the vacuum of space, on toxic worlds, or within hazardous ruins, a vacuum suit is your lifeline. Knowing how to operate and maintain it is essential for survival. A spacefaring explorer, a salvage operator, or anyone working in dangerous environments will need this skill.

*   **Drones:** Complexity 3 Drone software + 25% cost mod to make equipment remotely operable.
*   **Advantage Modifications:**
    *   Extended Lifespan: Max 2 levels.
    *   Extra Attack: Max 1 level.
    *   Intuition: Cost reduced to 5 points.
    *   Radiation Tolerance: Max divisor 10.
    *   Rapid Healing: Max Rank 1 (Rapid Healing).
    *   Reduced Consumption: Max 3 levels.
    *   Serendipity: Cost reduced to 10 points/level.

## **Magic System: Innate Human Potential**

*   **System:** Standard Magic rules (*GURPS Basic Set*, *GURPS Magic*).
*   **Source:** Magic is an inherent potential within all humans (represented by free Magery 0). This potential seems to resonate strongly with suitable life-bearing worlds under long-term, large-scale human habitation, creating the baseline mana level. Cultures interpret and access this potential differently (arcane study, divine channeling, intuitive practices), but the old empire studied it scientifically.
*   **Mana Levels:** Environmental mana varies:
    *   **Normal Mana:** Standard on planets with long-term, large-scale human populations (creating "Human Resonance"). Also found on major, intact Old Empire space habitats (e.g., O'Neill cylinders) where mana field generation was integrated infrastructure. Required for efficient spellcasting.
    *   **Low Mana (-5 Skill, x2 FP Cost, Slow FP Regen):** The default for space, including ship interiors, newer/smaller/damaged stations, asteroid bases, deep space outposts, uninhabited or newly colonized worlds, and planets where humanity has died out. Magic is difficult and costly.
    *   **No Mana:** Spellcasting impossible. Found in specific hazardous zones (e.g., deep radiation belts, near some power sources, inside active FTL drives) or areas with active counter-magic tech.
    *   **Wild Magic (Unpredictable Effects):** Possible in jump space, near intense stellar phenomena (gas giant magnetospheres, nebulae, black holes), or in magically unstable locations (ruins, experimental sites).
    *   **High Mana (+5 Skill, Half FP Cost):** Rare; might exist in unique natural locations, Old Empire sites, or near powerful magical artifacts.
    *   **Altered Mana:** Rare; specific locations might have unique rules (e.g., only certain colleges function, unusual side effects). Found in anomalies or Old Empire sites.
*   **Mana Field Generators:** Rare TL10/11 technology.
    *   *Ship Modules:* Self-contained (but large, expensive, power-hungry) units designed for starships using GURPS Traveller rules. Create a Normal Mana zone within the ship. Valuable salvage.
    *   *Station Systems:* Deeply integrated infrastructure in major Old Empire habitats. Not a discrete module; requires interaction with station's core systems (power, life support). Cannot be easily removed, stolen, or transplanted.
*   **Learning Spells:**
    *   **IQ/Hard Spells:** The bulk of magical knowledge. Can generally be learned through instruction or texts found within established traditions. Availability depends on the specific culture/location.
    *   **IQ/Very Hard Spells:** Represent complex, powerful, or lost magical knowledge (including most Technomancy). Learning *any* IQ/VH spell **requires discovering its specific Formula** (lost data, ancient grimoires, artifact schematics, etc.) in addition to meeting prerequisites.
*   **Aliens:** Non-human species generally lack innate magical ability, viewing human magic with a mix of fear, awe, and scientific interest.

## **Combat Philosophy: Don't Get Hurt**

*   TL10 medical technology performs wonders, but it **is not** always available, affordable, or fast enough. Characters operating in the recovery era should prioritize *not getting hit* in the first place. Invest points in active defenses (Dodge, Parry, Block) and acquire appropriate passive protection (Armor). Relying solely on toughness or hoping the medic can fix everything later is a risky strategy.
